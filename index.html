                    <p>To handle the situation, 264 shelters have been set up in Sylhet district. 6 of them are being used. About six and a half thousand people have taken shelter in these shelters. A large number of cattle are also facing food crisis in the flood waters. Besides, the farmers have not been able to dry the threshed paddy due to lack of sunshine for the last one week. Due to inability to dry the paddy, the ripe paddy is rotting.
 
                        Local administrations, various government departments and people's representatives are working with the people to deal with the flood disaster.</p>
